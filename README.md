# Prompt-Engineering-4.1
# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
# Description: 
The Smart Health Assistant System (SHAS) is an AI-driven platform designed to provide personalized health recommendations, symptom analysis, and wellness tracking. This experiment explores how different prompting techniques can enhance the system's ability to generate accurate, context-aware, and user-friendly responses.

## Objective:
1) Evaluate the effectiveness of different prompting techniques in generating health-related responses.

2) Compare structured vs. open-ended prompts in symptom analysis.

3)Assess the role of few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting in improving diagnostic accuracy.

4) Analyze how contextual prompting enhances user interaction.

### Scenario 1:
## Prompt:
"What are the possible causes of persistent headaches?"

## Output:
"Persistent headaches can be caused by tension, migraines, dehydration, lack of sleep, eye strain, high blood pressure, or underlying medical conditions such as sinusitis or brain tumors. Consult a doctor if headaches are severe or frequent."

## Analysis:

Provides a general response but lacks personalization.

Useful for broad queries but may not address specific user contexts.

### Scenario 2:
## Prompt:
"Example 1: A user reports fatigue and dizziness. Possible causes: dehydration, anemia, low blood sugar.
Example 2: A user has joint pain and swelling. Possible causes: arthritis, injury, autoimmune disease.
Now, analyze: A user experiences shortness of breath and chest tightness."

## Output:
"Possible causes: asthma, anxiety, heart disease, or pulmonary issues. Immediate medical attention is advised if severe."

## Analysis:

Improves accuracy by learning from examples.

Useful for structured symptom analysis.

### Scenario 3:

 ## Prompt:
"A user says they have a fever, sore throat, and runny nose. Explain step-by-step what this could indicate."

## Output:

Fever + Sore Throat + Runny Nose â†’ Likely viral infection (e.g., common cold or flu).

Check for additional symptoms: If cough and fatigue are present, flu is probable.

Duration: If symptoms persist beyond 10 days, consider bacterial infection (e.g., strep throat).

Recommendation: Rest, hydration, OTC meds; see a doctor if symptoms worsen.

## Analysis:

Enhances reasoning ability by breaking down symptoms logically.

Helps users understand the diagnostic process.

### Scenario 4:
## Prompt:
*"User profile: 35-year-old male, sedentary lifestyle, complains of lower back pain. Provide tailored advice."*

## Output:
*"Possible causes: poor posture, muscle strain, or herniated disc. Recommendations:

Improve ergonomics at work.

Perform stretching exercises (e.g., cat-cow pose).

Consider physiotherapy if pain persists.

Stay hydrated and maintain a healthy weight."*

 ## Analysis:

Delivers personalized recommendations.

More engaging and actionable for the user.

# Result
The experiment demonstrated that few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting provided the most accurate and logical health assessments, while contextual prompting delivered the most personalized recommendations. Zero-shot prompts were useful for general queries but lacked depth. Overall, combining these techniques can optimize the Smart Health Assistant System for both accuracy and user engagement.
